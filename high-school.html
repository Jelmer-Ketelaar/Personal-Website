     <p class="welcome"> Before this education, I did 4 years of Mavo before I started this training. I liked it, but it was very hard for me. </p>

      <p class="welcome"> In the 3rd class we had to choose a subject package. I knew that I was doing something about ICT so I asked my brothers what they had chosen to go the ICT side.</p> 

      <p class="welcome"> When I was in the 4th grade, we had to go to DaVinci to get an explanation about your education. Then I was with Application and Media developer and from that moment on I liked it and I knew that I would do this education.</p>

       <p class="welcome"> Later in the middle of the 4th class I had to go to a school, because we had a day where we got a sort of training day from the education you want to do. I decided to go to DaVinci and follow a day of Application and Media developer. I learned a lot and enjoyed so much. From that moment on I knew a 100% sure that I would do this training and I started to look into it more.</p>
