      <p class="work">When I was in high school I  worked at "de Plus", this is a grocery store in my town. When my contract was expired I stopped working there. The reason I stopped is because i didn't enjoy working there anymore. </p>

     <p class="work">Because I quit working I had find something else. My parents had their own business, a wine business so, I started working there and I still ,really like it. At this moment I'm still working at the company of my parents and I still enjoy it. I also work at "de bezorg Beren". This is one of the most famous delivery restaurant in my city.</p>
